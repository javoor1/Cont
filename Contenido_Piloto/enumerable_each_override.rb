# Hereâ€™s an example: find, which returns the first element in an enumerable object
# for which the code block provided returns true. Letâ€™s say we want to find the first color
# that begins with the letter y. We can do it with find, like this:
r = Rainbow.new
y_color = r.find {|color| color.start_with?('y') }
puts "First color starting with 'y' is #{y_color}."

# 10.2 Enumerable Boolean queries

# ARRAYS
# A number of Enumerable methods return true or false depending on whether one or
# more element matches certain criteria.

# Does the array include Louisiana?
>> states.include?("Louisiana")
=> true
# Do all states include a space?
>> states.all? {|state| state =~ / / }
=> false

# Does any state include a space?
>> states.any? {|state| state =~ / / }
=> true
# Is there one, and only one, state with "West" in its name?
>> states.one? {|state| state =~ /West/ }
=> true
# Are there no states with "East" in their names?
>> states.none? {|state| state =~ /East/ }
